# Year Zero Robotic Arm Project

* This repository for the Year Zero Robotic Arm project. 
* Included is Arduino sketch YearZeroRoboticArm.ino and some documentation.
* A sketch has been developed to use key functionality from [Braccio Robotic Arm](https://github.com/arduino-org/arduino-library-braccio)   so students do not have to download libraries. 
* Further modification includes Serial I/O
